			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>

					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>My challenge for lab 3 was just getting used to the 
						format, as well as working with HTML, CSS, images, and more.  
						Another challenge I faced was deciding on the design and color 
						scheme for my page. I didn't realize how much time goes into 
						creating a website.  
					</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>My issue with this lab wasn't with my code or HTML but with 
						images. I kept encountering a 'remote disconnected' error 
						when trying to push to the origin, and this went on for a 
						few days. I coundn't figure it out until, with the help of 
					    Ben and my roommate, we discovered that the images were causing 
						the problem. After deleting them and starting over, the push 
						finaly worked, and I was very happy.   
					</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Throughout this lab, I feel like I've grown more passionate about 
						the work. I realized that when something goes wrong with these
						programes, it can cause everything to go wrong. I learned that 
						it's important to take things step by step and be patient with the 
						process. Despite the challenges, I think I handled the ups and downs
						well and put a lot of effort into the lab. I'm proud of how it turned 
						out and how I presented it.
