				<h2>Challenge</h2> 
				<p>For Lab 14, the main challenge was using our knowledge and what we've been learning in class to 
                    revisit and fix old assignments that weren't functioning as expected. For me, the process felt  
                    rewarding because I've grown attached to the work I've done on the labs and enjoyed seeing how I  
                    was able to create them. Since my partner helped me along the way, I didn't encounter too many problems 
                    with my labs. However, I noticed that in Lab 10, the text wasn't displaying the way I wanted, so I decided 
                    to focus on debugging and improving it. Lab 10 was the only lab I really wanted to work on, as it felt like  
                    an opportunity to refine and perfect it. My biggest challenge was figuring out how to make my code work properly 
                    and identifying ways to fix and improve it.</p>
	
                <h2>Debugging</h2> 
				<p>For this debugging process, I focused on refining Lab 10 and enhancing its functionality. Initially, the text from  
                    Fantastic Mr. Fox wasn't displaying as I envisioned—it was coming out randomly rather than resembling the dialogue. 
                    I fixed this issue so the text now flows like actual dialogue. I then decided to take it a step further by adding color  
                    to the text to differentiate between the characters speaking. I used light orange for Felicity's dialogue and styled it in 
                    italics, while Mr. Fox's lines are displayed in yellow. In the left screenshot, you can see the original Lab 10, and on the 
                    right is the updated and improved version from Lab 14, showcasing the debugging and enhancements.   

                    <div class="image">
                        <img class="lab10" src="./img/lab10.jpg" alt="Lab 10">
                        <img class="lab14" src="./img/lab14.jpg" alt="Lab 14">
                    </div> 
                    
                </p>

				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I encountered some challenges while working on Lab 14. One of the first issues I faced was figuring out how to make the dialogue 
                    display in the correct sequence instead of randomly. I also learned how important proper spacing is—not just for making your code 
                    look clean, but also for ensuring it's organized and functions as intended. The second problem I faced was figuring out how to switch 
                    the colors dynamically. While I knew how to add colors, learning to toggle them based on the speaker was a bit confusing and required 
                    extra effort. These were the main challenges I encountered. The rest were smaller issues that I was able to resolve fairly quickly.</p>
			
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall, I really enjoyed working on Lab 14 and revisiting Lab 10 to figure out how to fix and elevate it. I feel like this was my proudest 
                    CSS work, and since I love the movie Fantastic Mr. Fox, it made the experience even more enjoyable. I'm glad I had the chance to revisit a 
                    lab that I didn't initially have enough time to perfect. When I first submitted Lab 10, the main issue that bothered me was that the dialogue 
                    wasn't displaying as intended—it was coming out randomly, which I didn't like. However, as I worked on it more and added improvements, I started 
                    to see a big difference. This lab is definitely the one I'm most proud of because I tackled it on my own without asking my partner for help, and 
                    it felt great to see it all come together. </p>
	
				<h2>Results</h2> 
				<p>At the bottom of the page in Lab 14, you can see the improvements made to Lab 10. I decided to keep the same colors and CSS from Lab 10 for Lab 14 
                    because I really liked how they turned out. Now, the dialogue is displayed as it't supposed to be, and you can tell who is speaking by the change 
                    in text color. I hope you enjoy it!
