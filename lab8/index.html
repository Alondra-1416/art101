			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">       
				<h2>Challenge</h2> 
				<p>My main challenge for Lab 8 was experimenting with functions and callbacks. 
                    I found it difficult at first to get used to how functions and the array.map 
                    method work together and to understand how the code fits as a whole. Overall, 
                    my biggest hurdle was just getting my mind to fully grasp the material and concepts 
                    in this lab. </p>
	
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>In Lab 8, one of my main problems was working with the console and then transferring my 
                    code from the console to my Lab 8 JavaScript file. I felt like I understood how things  
                    worked in the console, but when it came time to switch the code over to JavaScript, I had  
                    to make adjustments to get it to work correctly. This process required me to adapt my  
                    understanding of how code behaves in different environments.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall, Lab 8 was a bit tricky for me, but I'm glad I was able to work through it. I feel  
                    like I had a few successes, along with many learning moments that helped me understand the  
                    material better. Even when I don't fully grasp everything at first, working through the lab 
                    gives me valuable opportunities to learn.</p>
	
				<h2>Results</h2> 
				<p>Open up the console to view the results of Lab 8. In the console, you'll be able to see the output 
                    from the functions and callbacks we implemented, as well as any calculations or transformations 
                    applied to the data. </p>
