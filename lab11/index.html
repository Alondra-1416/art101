				<h2>Challenge</h2> 
				<p>My main challenge for Lab 11 was collaborating with my partner and experimenting with  
					JavaScript events. My biggest challenge was getting comfortable with JavaScript and  
					exploring how it works. Luckily, my roommate gave me a helpful mini-lesson, which made  
					things clearer. Another challenge I faced was creating the new files and folders for the  
					lab; I tend to forget the steps for setting them up, but with practice, it's becoming easier. </p>
	
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>Lab 11 initially felt straightforward. My partner and I worked on the coding together, and  
					everything seemed to be going smoothly. However, when I pushed my code to GitHub, mine wasn's  
					working while theirs ran perfectly. In my version, only the button appeared, and I couldn't get 
					it to trigger any output. My partner and I reviewed my HTML and JavaScript thoroughly, trying  
					various fixes, but nothing worked. Finally, I copied my JavaScript code, deleted it, and then  
					pasted it back in—and suddenly, it worked! It was a strange issue, but I'm glad I was able to  
					solve it in the end.</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>When I first read through the instructions for Lab 11, I felt a bit overwhelmed and unsure how to  
					approach it. I felt lost at the start, but luckily, my roommate was able to help me understand the 
					goal of the lab, which made a big difference. Once I knew what I needed to do, the tasks became easier. 
					Later, I ran into a problem that had me worried for about an hour—I thought my code might be totally wrong. 
					But after reviewing it carefully, I found a small issue, fixed it, and everything worked perfectly. I was 
					so relieved!</p>
	
				<h2>Results</h2> 
				<p>Now that we've reached the end, you can see my results at the bottom of the page. Enter something in the text 
					box, click the button, and the output will be displayed. </p>
