				<h2>Challenge</h2> 
				<p>In Lab 13, our challenge was to collaborate with our partner and experiment with loops. 
                    My personal challenge was working with JavaScript, specifically writing the loops and 
                    figuring out how everything worked. I struggled to get my code to work at first, which 
                    was frustrating. I realized that my real challenge was learning to step back, take a break, 
                    and come back to the problem with a fresh perspective. Once I did that, I was able to focus 
                    and tackle the challenge more effectively.</p>
	
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>For Lab 13, once I understood the basics and had thoroughly read the instructions and done some 
                    additional research, I started getting the hang of my code and learning how loops work. The 
                    problem I encountered was interestingâ€”my output wasn't showing up. My partner and I reviewed 
                    my code and couldn't find anything wrong. Finally, I decided to copy and paste the code back into 
                    the file, adjust the spacing, and reformat it slightly. Surprisingly, that fixed the issue, and my 
                    output worked perfectly. That was the only real problem I encountered with Lab 13.</p>
			
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall, I felt Lab 13 went really well. I had a great partner who was incredibly helpful, they took 
                    the time to teach me and explain what my code was supposed to do and how to read it, which was very 
                    helpful since I was confused about how some things worked. Their guidance really helped me understand 
                    those aspects better. I also thought the lab was a great hands-on learning experience. Working through 
                    it allowed me to learn through trial and error, giving me the opportunity to really understand my code, how 
                    it works and what it does.  </p>
	
				<h2>Results</h2> 
				<p>Now that you've reached this point, you can see the output and all the fun elements displayed at the bottom 
                    of the page. I hope you enjoy! Go crazy and look at the FIZZ, BUZZ, BOOM!! </p>
