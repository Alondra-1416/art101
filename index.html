				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p> My Name is Alondra, and I am a third-year Arts and Design major at UCSC.
					I'm from a small town called Sonoma, about an hour away from San Franscisco. 
					I have two neices that I love so much, and I'll take any chance to talk about  
					them! I'm passionate about art and am gradually moving into animation, which is
					my true passion. I love going for runs and listing to music. I'm also a huge dog 
					lover-I enjoy dog-sitting and volunterring at the animal shelter in my free time.  
					If I see a dog, I can't resist petting it. I'd describe myself as a funny and  
					easygoing person, always laughing at my own jokes. Well, that's me, and as Lizzy 
					once said, "Well, that's my life."
