				<h2>Challenge</h2> 
				<p>The challenge for this lab is experimenting with basic JavaScript 
					data types and variables. One of the main challenges I faced was 
					getting comfortable with the console and learning the bascics of 
					JavaScript, with all the data types and variables. It also took some 
					time to gain experiance with the console and understand how it works.</p>
	
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>With Lab 5, some of the problems I encountered involved figuring out  
					the layout so that everything would fit properly on the page. I also  
					struggled with styling and the use of whitespace, which felt like 
					learning a new language with its own set of rules. </p>
			
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>In Lab 5, I felt that I gained a deeper understanding of the console and 
					learned more about how JavaScript and its formatting work. I especially  
					enjoyed that we got to choose and research our own cars for the project.  
					To my surprise, I had a lot of fun building the page and felt I put a good  
					amount of energy into it. </p>
	
				<h2>Results</h2> 
				<p>At the bottom of the page, you can see the results of Lab 5. I had a great  
					time working on this project, and I even got to research my dream carâ€”now  
					you can learn a little bit about it too!</p>
