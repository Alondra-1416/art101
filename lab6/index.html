					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge for Lab 6 was to work with our partners to experiment with 
						JavaScript arrays and objects. One of the main challenges I encountered  
						was learning how to declare and list the properties of a vehicle object.  
						Understanding how objects work in JavaScript and figuring out how to display  
						them correctly on the webpage.</p>
		
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>In Lab 6, I didn't really encounter any significant issues. This was one of the  
						first labs I completed on my own without getting stuck or needing help from my  
						partner. The only minor problem was learning how JSON.stringify works, as it 
						was new to me, but I quickly understood it. Overall, this lab went smoothly, and 
						I felt more independent and confident in my coding abilities. </p>
	
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, I think this lab went really well. I didn't encounter any issues, and I was 
						able to follow the directions in the class lab smoothly. I also noticed that I completed  
						this lab faster than previous ones, which makes me feel like I'm truly starting to learn 
						and understand the material. My confidence in tackling these labs is definitely growing. </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>  
					<p>At the bottom of the page, you can see the results of Lab 6. I had a great time working with my 
						 partner with this lab. In the results you are able to see how our program successfuly was able 
						 to show MyRide the make, modle, age, etc.</p>
