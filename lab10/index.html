				<h2>Challenge</h2> 
				<p>For Lab 10, our challenge was to experiment with DOM manipulation and  
                    collaborate with our partners. My personal challenge was to understand  
                    how DOM manipulation works while also learning to work with JavaScript. 
                    My main focus was to get a solid grasp of how things function with DOM 
                    manipulation. It took some time, but by carefully reading the lab instructions 
                    and doing my own research, I was able to learn quite a bit. The hands-on experiments 
                    also helped me better understand how my code works and why it behaves as expected.</p>
	
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>When it came to Lab 10, I was able to manage most of it, but I did encounter some problems  
                    along the way. First, I had an issue with my JavaScript. My partner helped me realize that 
                     I had placed const newText and output.append in the wrong section, so I moved them into the  
                     make-convo function, which fixed the problem.The next issue I encountered was with my CSS. For 
                     some reason, the colors I chose weren't showing up. My partner experienced the same problem, so  
                     we worked together to troubleshoot. For her, copying and pasting her Lab 9 CSS and HTML into Lab 10 and making 
                     adjustments resolved the issue. For me, I copied and pasted my Lab 7 CSS and HTML into Lab 10 and made the necessary 
                     changes. Initially, it worked only partially, but once I changed my CSS selector from main to #constant, everything  
                     started working correctly.</p>
			
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Overall, I feel like Lab 10 went well. I encountered some challenges and problems along the way, but with the help of my partner 
                     and some effort to figure things out on my own, we were able to resolve those issues, and I was able to complete the lab. I had
                     a fun time experimenting with everything. Once everything was set up and running, it was fascinating to see how pressing the 
                     "Say Something" button would generate new text based on how I had written the code. It was exciting to experiment and see it all 
                     come together. I also enjoyed working on the CSS and selecting the dialogue. I chose a famous scene from Fantastic Mr. Fox, one 
                     of my favorite movies. I especially love the line, "I think I have this thing where I need everyone to think I'm the greatest—the 
                     quote-unquote Fantastic Mr. Fox." There's something so fun and satisfying about movies referencing their own titles in the dialogue, 
                     and it added a personal touch to the project. </p>
	
				<h2>Results</h2> 
				<p>At the bottom of the page, you can see the results for Lab 10. When you press the "Say Something" button, it 
                    outputs dialogue from Fantastic Mr. Fox, specifically the scene where he says, "I think I have this thing where 
                    I need everyone to think I'm the greatest—the quote-unquote Fantastic Mr. Fox." The text includes the entire section 
                    of that iconic line. I hope you enjoy it!
