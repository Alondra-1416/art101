			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">       
				<h2>Challenge</h2> 
				<p>The challenge for this lab was learning to write functions that could take 
					 user input and manipulate it into a formatted string. Another unexpected  
					 challenge was creating an index.html file for this lab, as we also needed  
					 to organize everything into specific folders for Lab 7. Since I had never  
					 set up folders like this before, my partners were incredibly helpful, guiding 
					 me through the process of organizing and setting up the Lab 7 folders. Their 
					 support made it much easier for me to learn and complete the lab successfully.</p>
	
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>With Lab 7, one of my main problems was learning how to write code for functions  
					that would actually perform as intended. I realized that I needed to be clear about 
					what I wanted the computer to do, which required careful planning and understanding 
					of each step. My partner was a great help, explaining and guiding me through the process, 
					as well as showing me how to structure the code properly. I discovered that I hadn't been  
					documenting things as thoroughly as I should, so this lab was a valuable lesson in organizing 
					my code and communicating my intentions effectively.. </p>
			
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>In Lab 7, Throughout this project, I feel like I gained valuable experience in coding and deepened 
					my understanding of writing functions to capture user input and convert it into a string. Grasping  
					that process was both challenging and rewarding, and learning about it kept me engaged. Additionally,  
					creating the index.html file for Lab 7 and setting up the folders was a great introduction to organizing  
					project files, which helped me understand how to structure a project more effectively. </p>
	
				<h2>Results</h2> 
				<p>At the bottom of the page, you can see the results of Lab 7. I had a good time 
					working with my partner with this lab. In the results you are able to see how 
					our program successfuly sorted the names.
