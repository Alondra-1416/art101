			<h1>Lab 9 - Libraries & jQuery</h1>
			<div id="Challenge">       
				<h2>Challenge</h2> 
				<p>For Lab 9, our challenge was to collaborate with our partners and experiment with jQuery. 
                    My partner has more experience and was helping me throughout the process. My personal 
                    challenge was to learn jQuery by experimenting and figuring everything out on my own. 
                </p>
            </div> 

            <div id="Problems">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>Lab 9 was a bit difficult for me. I first I had a problem getting my button to appear, but my  
                    partner was able to help me with itâ€”there was just something I had missed. Then came the  
                    bigger problem: getting the button to work. It took a lot of trial and error, but I finally 
                    figured it out. It turned out that I had the CSS in the wrong place, so I fixed that. I feel 
                    like I encountered a lot of problems with Lab 9, but I was able to resolve them, even though 
                    it took a long time.  
                </p>
            </div>  

            <div id="Reflection">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Lab 9 was okay to work on. I learned a lot about jQuery and was able to learn from my partner. 
                    For the most part, I was able to work through Lab 9 pretty well and figure everything out. It 
                    wasn't until the end that I had problems with the buttons and getting them to work and display 
                    anything. I feel like that was the most challenging part, but in the end, with help from my partner, 
                    I was able to figure it out, and it all worked out.
                </p>
            </div> 

            <div id="Results">
				<h2>Results</h2> 
				<p>Now, in the "Results" section, there is a button that says "Make Special," and something unique happens 
                    when you press it. You can do this with all the buttons, and each one triggers a special effect.  
                </p>
