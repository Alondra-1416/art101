			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>For this lab 4 the challenge was to start learning and getting 
						hands on experinces with Pseudocode and javascript file, and 
						overall doing javascribt comments. I think when it came to the 
						overall challenge I think it was just learning Pseudocoding. 
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I think for this lab one of the biggest problems was just learning 
						how Pseudocode works and how to do the javascribt comments. I also  
						think that one of my problem that I encounted was turning my simple 
						list and steps to actuall javascribt comments. 
				 </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I feel like throught this lab I felt like it was a good experince 
						learning about Pseudocode. I also feel like my partner and I did a 
						great job in finding time and working together and helping each other 
						out and I feel like we put a lot of energy and worked hard on this lab. 
					 </p>

					<h2>Results</h2> 
					<pre><code>
			<h2>Pseudocode an everyday task</h2> <h2>Baking Conchas</h2>
Get 3 ¾ cups all-purpose flour,  ½ cup + 2 tbs white sugar, 7.5 grams instant dry yeast, 
½ tsps salt, ½ cup butter, 100 ml eggs,1 tsps vanilla, ½ cup milk
½ cup + 1 tsps vegetable shortening, 100 grams confectioner sugar,5 grams cocoa powder 
Mix all dry ingredients ( 3 ¾ cups all purpose flour, ½ cup + 2 tbs white sugar, ½ tsps salt,) 
in bowl and mix well
Add butter and mixAdd your eggs, and vanilla, and mix until you reach a dough consistency
Keep mixing for a while
After 10ish minutes, you will have a soft texture (somewhat sticky)
Kneed your dough and shape into a ball-like shape
Get a bowl covered in grease, put dough in, and let rest for 2 hours with plastic wrap
Preheat oven to 325
Let dough rise in a warm place like the top of a stove
Make toppings -> Mix vegetable shorting in a bowl until creamy
Add confectioner sugar and a bit of flour so it doesn't get too sticky
Add your flavor powder (coco powder)
Mix ingredients well and set aside
Once it is ready, divide the dough into smaller balls 
Put the dough into a greased pan with space in between each ball.
Flatten out the topping and make strips to put on top of top of the dough
Have fun with it, maybe cut the strips
Let rise a bit more then put in the oven for 2 hours
Then put them in the oven for 15-20 minutes
Then get a gold consistency on the top, edges, or bottom
Then when they turn golden, take them out of the oven, and DONE
