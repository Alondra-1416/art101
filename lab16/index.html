				<h2>Challenge</h2> 
				<p>The challenge for Lab 16 was working with our partners and experimenting with processing JSON from an API. The most difficult part 
                    was learning how it all works. When I first looked at Wes's page, it seemed pretty complicated, and I felt a bit nervous about this 
                    lab since it was definitely more complex than what we had done before. Thankfully, my partner was very knowledgeable and helped guide 
                    me through the process, which was crucial for my understanding. My biggest challenge was not only learning the concept but also figuring 
                    out how to apply it in my code. For this lab, I had to take things step by step, which is often the best approach for me when tackling 
                    something new and complex.</p>

				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>The problems I faced with Lab 16 mainly revolved around understanding my code and figuring out why it wasn't working. At first, I kept 
                    encountering glitches, and for some reason, my comic wasn't displaying. Fortunately, my partner was able to guide me through the issues, 
                    helping me understand why my code wasn't functioning as expected while also teaching me along the way. After some adjustments, my code started 
                    working, and I was finally able to see the comic, which was really exciting. After resolving that, my partner and I decided to tackle the extra 
                    credit. I ran into some additional issues there, primarily due to glitches, but we were able to work through them together. Overall, while I faced 
                    several challenges, my partner and I managed to address and resolve them successfully.</p>
			
				<h2>Reflection</h2> 
					  <p>Overall, I really enjoyed working on Lab 16—our LAST LAB! It was a bittersweet moment knowing it marked the end of this journey. This class has taught 
					me so much, and I feel like I've gained valuable skills that I can carry forward into my future classes. Now, if I want to create a website, I not only 
					know how to do it but also understand how everything works behind the scenes.  </p>

					<p>Working with our partners throughout the course was such a great decision. I was able to help my partner with some things, and she helped me with others, 
					especially when it came to coding. During this lab, my partner explained everything in detail, which I truly appreciated.  </p>
					
					<p>Lab 16 felt like a perfect way to wrap up the class. Reflecting on the past assignments and seeing how far we've come has been an amazing experience. It's 
					been such a pleasure being part of this class, and I'm grateful for everything I've learned along the way. </p>

				<h2>Results</h2> 
				<p>At the bottom of the page, you can view our Lab 16 project. The surprise and extra credit feature is that you're not limited to seeing just one comic strip—you 
					can explore several different, cool ones! I hope you enjoy it!
